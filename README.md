# Deep-Learning-based-Gait-Abnormality-Detection

Design & Development of a Wearable Sensor Platform used for quantitative analysis using Deep Learning for detecting abnormal characteristics associated with human gait.  

In this research a wearable sensor system is presented, which combines **Plantar pressure measurement unit** and **Inertial Measurement Units (IMUâ€™s)** integrated with a stacked Long short-term memory (LSTM) model to detect human gait abnormalities that are prone to the risk of fall.
